# DontTalkAbouttheCops

What is the goal of the project?
I am going to cross-reference data from The Counted API, The Guardian's API of police-officer related killings; and Capitol Words API, an API that "extracts language daily from the Congressional Record, which reports the full text of deliberations in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate" to look at how frequently terms like "police brutality" are used in government.

Who is the target audience (can be just yourself)?
I suppose it's mostly me, since I'm not sure yet if I'll find any interesting correlations. I just want to experiment with data.

What are your personal learning goals?
My goals are to try some TDD, to practice creating wrappers, and to delve into APIs and data that I find interesting. 

What technologies/frameworks/patterns will you be employing?
I'll be using ruby, rails, RESTful routing, maybe some Bootstrap, definitely the APIs.

What are the tech and/or skill dependencies of your project?
See above.

What does success look like for this project? What does done mean?
Success means having some data to display. My low goal is to pull the data and display it simply; medium goal is to have multiple comparisons or queries; high goal is to have visual representation like graphs or somethin'.
